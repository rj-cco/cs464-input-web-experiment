    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <strong>Overview of Experiment</strong>: This experiment is going to require the use of a laptop and the availability of an external keyboard/mouse that works with the laptop. <strong>PLEASE DO NOT USE AN EXTERNAL MONITOR</strong>.
        In one section, you will be required to use the laptop with the external keyboard and mouse to perform the tasks in that section. In the other section, you will be required to use the native keyboard
        and trackpad of the laptop to perform the tasks in the section. Each section area is defined by labels and the "start" and "stop" buttons (there are separate start and stop buttons for each section). You will be required to type in text boxes and press
        the start, stop, and submit buttons that appear on the page based on which section you are working in. Further directions will be given in each section of the experiment page.
    </p>

        <strong> Initial Setup Directions </strong>: You will be assigned a number by the researcher, this number will either be
        1 or 2. If you are assigned with the number <strong>1</strong> then please start with the section labeled with a <strong>1</strong>
        and <strong>External Keyboard/Mouse</strong>. If you are assigned with the number <strong>2</strong>
        then please start with the section labeled with a <strong>2</strong> and <strong>Native Laptop Keyboard/Trackpad</strong>. Upon
        completion of your assigned section, and <strong>only upon completion of your initially assigned section</strong>, please then perform the tasks in the other section
        with the required input device type. For example, if you are assigned with the number 1, then please first complete the tasks in section 1 with the proper input devices, and then perform the tasks in section 2 with
        the proper input devices for section 2. After you have completed the task in both sections, there will be a button at the bottom of the page to take you to a survey. Again, further directions will come in the experiment page.
