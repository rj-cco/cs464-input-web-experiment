# cs464-input-web-experiment

The source code in this repo is for a website built for a CS464 (Human-Computer Interaction) research project at Colorado State University.

The website was developed as the method of testing whether different input devices had any significant effect on typing/navigation task completion speed and accuracy on a laptop.

The website is hosted here: https://cs.colostate.edu/~rjcalk/cs464experiment/home.html
